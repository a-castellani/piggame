          <p>1. Player one starts the game</p>
          <p>2. After each roll, the player accumulates points based on the
            face
            value of the die: </p>
          <p> - If a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends, and they lose all
            points gained during that turn.</p>
          <p> - If any other number is rolled (2 to 6), the player can choose
            to
            continue rolling or stop and add the rolled number to their turn
            total.</p>
          <p>3. Players can continue rolling as long as they want, but if they
            roll a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated in
            that turn.</p>
          <p>4. A player can choose to "hold" at any time during their turn to
            add their turn total to their overall score and pass the dice to the
            next player.</p>
          <p>5. The game continues with each player taking turns, trying to
            reach
            the winning score 100 points without rolling a 1.</p>
